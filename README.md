# Personal Projects

Welcome to my personal projects repository! This collection showcases various Python projects I have developed.

## Overview

This repository includes:
- **chat bot**: A simple chatbot implementation.
- **password generator**: A script for generating secure passwords and more.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Orcus-IRL/personal_projects.git
    ```

    ```sh
    cd personal_projects
    ```

3. **Explore the Projects**:
    Each folder contains a README with specific instructions for the project.

## Projects

- **chat bot**: A basic chatbot to demonstrate simple AI interactions(have to update that).
- **password generator**: A utility to create strong and random passwords.
- **UPDATE**: I have written a program that will follow the maximum number of people on instagram automatically. I am currently testing it to run like 4 times a day. Because you can follow only 200 people per hour on instagram, so I have to make it wait for an hour after following 200 people. If you want to see that project let me know.
